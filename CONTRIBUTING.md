## Running sync.bible Locally

If you’d like to contribute code, first, you will need to run sync.bible locally. Here is the short version:

1.	Make sure you have git, node and npm installed
2.	Clone this repository locally with git@github.com:syncbible/syncbible.git
3.	Execute npm start to install packages and start the server
4.	Open http://localhost:7777 in your browser. I find it best to work in Firefox in private mode to avoid caching issues.

## Pull Requests

When you have a patch ready to submit in your local version you need to submit a pull request so it can be reviewed before being merged. Here is a typical workflow:

1. Make sure your local repo is up to date: `git pull`
2. Create a new branch locally and check it out: `git checkout -b branch-name"
3. Add the files you have changed: `git add filename.js`
4. Commit the files: `git commit -m "Commit message goes here"
5. Push your local branch to the remote server: `git push --set-upstream origin branch-name`
6. Open the repo and use the GUI to create and submit a pull request from this branch: https://github.com/syncbible/syncbible
